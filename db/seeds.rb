# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# user = User.create(name: 'Kwasi Baayeh', photo: 'My profile pic', bio: 'I am the coolest')

# post = Post.create(author: user, title: 'Hello man!!', text: 'This is my original post')

# comment = Comment.create(author: user, post: post, text: 'Hi Kwasi!' )

# like = Like.create(post: post, author: user)
